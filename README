vfdlib - a graphics api library for empeg userland apps
*******************************************************

Version 3 - 6th September 2002

Copyright (C) 2002  Richard Kirkby

** find the latest version at http://empeg-vfdlib.sourceforge.net **

Introduction:

  I recognized a barrier to implementing userland apps on the empeg/riocar
  as being the lack of custom graphics libraries. I personally would like to
  see a lot more development, and sought to help myself and others overcome
  the initial barrier by writing my own set of graphics routines.

  I see a lot of potential for this library in combination with hijack (thanks
  to mlord) and the efforts of others for a wealth of cool userland apps on the
  empeg! Now if only someone would automate the installation process of apps
  then we would really be getting somewhere...

Features:

  * Ability to draw points, lines, rectangles, ellipses, polygons, text and
    bitmaps.

  * Can use the same font files the player uses!

  * Drawing operations fully clipped to a user definable rectangle. Those of
    you hungry for more speed can bypass the clipping overhead when careful
    to ensure drawing operations will not leak outside the display area.

  * Written in C with the empeg in mind, meaning fast, compact, optimized
    integer routines.

  * Think you can do better? Please do! The code is open source - help to make 
    it better and share the results with the rest of us.
